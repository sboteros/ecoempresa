  abstract = "Renewable power from wind, solar PV, or biomass reached market penetration with large full-scale deployment within about four decades of the first oil crisis. This required overcoming ideological hurdles and electricity incumbents' vested interests. Chief ideological hurdle was neoclassical economics with its restricted role for public policy in technology innovation, thus policy initiatives came about in only a few countries with special political constellations. EU institutions reflected those conflicts; their renewed intensification in the 2010s led to a setback for renewables in Europe. But by then the breakthrough on costs put renewables in a good position to thrive on all continents."
